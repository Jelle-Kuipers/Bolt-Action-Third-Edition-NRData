# Bolt Action: Third Edition Data Repository  

Welcome to the **Third Edition [Bolt Action World War II](https://www.warlordgames.com/boltaction/index.html) Tabletop Wargame** data repository! This repository contains all the necessary data files for managing and organizing your Bolt Action lists.  

## How does this work?
These files need a list/roster builder to function. I personally recommend [NewRecruit](https://www.newrecruit.eu/).
The files are made with NewRecruit in mind. While they should still work on other list editors. I cannot guarantee that they work. <u>**And they are not supported by this repository.**</u>  

## How to add the files to your NewRecruit
It's quite simple, just follow this step by step tutorial.

### Adding datafiles to NewRecruit
1. In NewRecruit, navigate to the games overview.
2. Press the "Add more games" button.
3. Here, select "Add from Github"
4. Under Version, ~~select "Latest Release"~~ #As we have no real V1 release yet, use "Latest Commit (Head)
5. Under Repository, paste: "Jelle-Kuipers/Bolt-Action-Third-Edition-NRData"
6. Press the green + button and wait.
7. "Bolt Action: Third edition" should now be showing in your games list.

And you are ready to start making and editing your list!

## I've found a bug/issue/improvement!  
Great! Please open an issue in the issues tab where you:
1. Mention the book(s) this issue takes place in.
2. Describe the change or issue as best as you can.
3. If applicable, provide the alternative or correct data. If you can qoute or source your data, even better!

Example Issue:

```
In the Armies of the soviet union, the AMPULOMET weapon profile has HE (1") instead of HE (2"). See Page 48 of "Bolt Action: Armies of the Soviet Union: Third Edition"
```

Please keep in mind, I can only handle data and validation errors. Issues with the NewRecruit itself are outside the scope of this repo.

<u>**Compatability errors with other list builders are not guaranteed to be picked up. Feel free to try your solving them on your own and adding them in a PR.**</u>  

## Contributing
Please feel welcome to contribute. As I'm currently working solo, adding and maintaining armies is a slow process. The more the merrier!

If you wish to contribute, feel free to fork or pull this repository and work on a seperate branch. If you are tackling an issue, please link the issue in your PR and await feedback.

### Tools and tutorials
All work is currently being done using the New Recruit data editing tools, found [here](https://www.newrecruit.eu/download/).

If you are new to data editing and want to give it a shot, [this tutorial](https://github.com/DerTanteKethe/custom40k-homebrew-system/wiki/NewRecruit-Data-Author-Tutorial) should help get you started.

### Contact
If you get stuck, or wish to ask a question I'd recommend the [new recruit discord](https://discord.gg/cCtqGbugwb) or the [bsdata developers discord](https://discord.gg/pMXqCqWJRE). From my own experience these people are patient, willing to explain and help and very kind. If you are able to answer a question, answer. Sharing knowledge keeps projects alive!

In future, there might be a seperate discord made if there is enough interest in this game system. For now you can also just contact me on Discord by adding me directly: Jelly_666

I also have access to the majority of the source material, so if you need a reference hit me up and I can probably answer your question.

## General Contact
If you have any questions, suggestions or other issues. feel free to contact me by adding me on discord, my username is jelly_666
Alternatively, you can try making a github issue. But discord is the fastest way to get in touch.
